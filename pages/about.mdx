Welcome to **Systemais**. We are a unique collaboration between RIBA-qualified architects and 
professional software engineers, working together to create bespoke solutions and innovative web applications.


## Our Mission
Our mission is to bridge the gap between architectural excellence and the latest technology. 
We combine architectural expertise with software engineering to deliver cost-effective yet comprehensive solutions 
that meet the evolving needs of the modern built environment.

## Our Expertise

As RIBA-qualified architects, we are better equipped to understand the daily issues you experience. 
We have worked in architectural and construction companies for over 10 years and 
have seen many wasted hours on tasks that could easily be automated/digitised or even eliminated by other processes. 



This led us to collaboration with professional software engineers to start designing custom software, 
web applications and digital solutions that can improve day-to-day life 
of small-medium architectural practices (and other AEC companies). 

## Our Approach

Our team brings together the best of both worlds of architecture and software engineering to deliver exceptional results for our clients. 

### Technologies We Use

**Website Development:**
- JavaScript, React, Next.js, HTML
- Modern web frameworks and responsive design

**AI & Machine Learning:**
- AI-powered solutions for construction industry
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - Advanced AI that combines language models with real-time data retrieval for accurate, evidence-based responses

**Microsoft 365 Integration:**
- SharePoint as project CDE (Common Data Environment)
- SharePoint as internal CDE for team collaboration
- Power Apps and Power Platform solutions

> **No one solution fits all - every project or problem is unique.**

We believe in creating tailored solutions that address the specific challenges of each client, rather than applying generic approaches. Every architectural practice and construction company has unique workflows, requirements, and pain points that deserve custom attention.

Get in touch with your problem and we will do our best to solve it!
