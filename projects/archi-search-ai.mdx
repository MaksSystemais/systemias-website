## Story

Following the success of our OpenAI topic-specific chatGPT assistants, we have taken regulatory search to the next level.  
While native GPT chat can provide quick answers, they lack a reliable way to **validate responses against the actual Approved Documents** — and in building regulations, precision is critical.  

To solve this, we developed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine with a vector database** for natural language search. This means users not only receive clear AI-generated explanations, but also get direct links to the relevant sections of the regulations for instant validation.  

The tool also goes beyond simple “yes/no” queries. It supports **complex reasoning** where compliance depends on context, helping architects and designers navigate grey areas with evidence-backed answers.
