# The problem

The machinery maintenance is a job that is required to be undertaken in various site and weather conditions, yet it has to  be accurately recorded and passed on to the client for their records.

The machinery maintenance company found that existing job management tools were either too generic or overly complex and expensive for their requirements. 

As silly as it may sound, one of the issues was that apps available on market are too fiddly and a field engineer, who needs to enter data live (rain or shine, clean or oily hands..), requires something that is simple, effective and user-friendly. Engineers could not find the app on the market that would right-fit option.


# The solution
We developed a tailored yet cost-effective Power Apps solution for field machinery engineers to record, track, and manage their jobs. It is designed in close collaboration with field engineers to address their workflows.

The system includes:
* Job tracking and status updates
* Machinery records and maintenance logs
* Client and site address databases
* Auto-generated job sheets (Repair, Service, LOLER Inspection) with image upload and email dispatch

# Looking ahead
Based on the success of our SharePoint solution and growing market demand, we are now looking to build a dedicated web application - the Construction Plant Maintenance (CPM) App. We are seeking partners and investors to help us create an all-in-one platform that will serve both independent plant engineers and machinery owners/managers.

Visit [CPM App landing page](https://cpm-app.netlify.app/) to learn more about web application proposal and join the waiting list.

# For Engineers & Plant Managers
If you are interested in using the CPM web app, visit our [landing page](https://cpm-app.netlify.app/) and join the waiting list to be notified when the platform launches.

# For Investors
We welcome discussions with potential investors who are interested in supporting the development of the CPM platform. You can express your interest through the sign-up form on our [landing page](https://cpm-app.netlify.app/) - just select "I want to invest in development" in the role selector.
