# The hidden cost of manual drawing issue registers

In the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, there's a silent productivity killer: the manual drawing issue register. This seemingly simple document, often maintained in Excel, is a critical quality assurance requirement that tracks the distribution of project documentation. However, our research reveals that a mid-size architectural firm with 70 employees can lose up to 28 days annually in billable hours spent maintaining these registers.

# The problem - more than just paperwork

- **Time-consuming process** - architects and engineers can spend hours retrospectively manually logging document distributions
- **Inconsistent updates** - registers are often updated irregularly due to the manual nature of the process
- **Hidden costs** 
  - Lost billable hours
  - Inefficient resource allocation
  - Increased risk of documentation logging errors
- **Quality assurance gaps** - When documentation is needed for compliance or dispute resolution, incomplete registers can lead to serious issues

# Why existing solutions fall short?
The market offers several document management systems, but they often:
- ❌ Require complex implementation and training
- ❌ Come with prohibitively high costs
- ❌ Fail to specifically address the drawing issue register problem 
- ❌ Require significant manual input despite their digital nature
- ❌ Endless discovery calls and quotation reviews

# The solution 

Share&Log was born from a simple observation - if we can automate the metadata extraction from drawings, we can eliminate the manual work of maintaining issue registers.
