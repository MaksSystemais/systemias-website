*Built with Microsoft 365 SharePoint Online. Delivered entirely in-house. No external consultancy costs.*

## Story

In 2022, a UK architectural practice set out to improve internal communication, accessibility of information, and team collaboration. The goal was simple: to create a **central intranet** that would bring together everything from project standards and policies to HR resources and company news — all in one place.

The result was **The Hub**, a fully customised intranet built using **Microsoft SharePoint Online**, part of their existing M365 licence.  
> **No additional software. No external consultants. Just thoughtful configuration, user-focused design, and internal expertise.**

---

## Solution

The Hub was designed, developed and deployed using standard SharePoint **no-code** tools and a lightweight layer of customisation to fit the client's needs.

**Key features include:**
- A custom-designed **home page dashboard** with news, quick links, and announcements  
- **Company resources all in one place** — templates, policies, and standards accessible to all staff
- **Ecosystem of practice management Power Apps** for HR, IT management, and more  
- **Management team landing page** for all-in-one-place access to key dashboards and tools
- Department pages for HR, IT, Finance, QA, and Project Standards  
- Integrated **document libraries** for controlled templates and forms  
- A built-in **news publishing system** for internal updates  
- Searchable **knowledge base** of FAQs, guides, and policies  
- Embedded **Power Apps** for interactive tools  

---

## M365 Integration in Action

One of the strengths of building an intranet on SharePoint is the seamless integration with the wider **Microsoft 365 ecosystem**. The Hub demonstrates this through embedded custom applications that extend its functionality.

### Example: Office Plan Power App

<div style={{marginTop: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
  <img 
    src="/images/project-sharepoint-intranet-office-plan.png" 
    alt="Shop Office Planning Power App" 
    title="Click to expand" 
    style={{width: '100%', height: 'auto', border: 'none', cursor: 'pointer', transition: 'opacity 0.3s ease'}} 
    onMouseOver={(e) => e.currentTarget.style.opacity = '0.8'} 
    onMouseOut={(e) => e.currentTarget.style.opacity = '1'}
    onClick={(e) => {
      const modal = document.createElement('div');
      modal.style.cssText = 'position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.9); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; z-index: 9999; cursor: pointer;';
      const img = document.createElement('img');
      img.src = e.currentTarget.src;
      img.style.cssText = 'max-width: 90%; max-height: 90%; object-fit: contain;';
      const closeBtn = document.createElement('button');
      closeBtn.innerHTML = '✕';
      closeBtn.style.cssText = 'position: absolute; top: 20px; right: 20px; background: white; border: none; font-size: 30px; width: 40px; height: 40px; border-radius: 50%; cursor: pointer; color: #333; box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);';
      closeBtn.onmouseover = () => closeBtn.style.background = '#f0f0f0';
      closeBtn.onmouseout = () => closeBtn.style.background = 'white';
      modal.appendChild(img);
      modal.appendChild(closeBtn);
      modal.onclick = (e) => { if (e.target === modal || e.target === closeBtn) document.body.removeChild(modal); };
      document.body.appendChild(modal);
    }}
  />
</div>

To streamline workspace management, a custom **Power App** was developed and embedded directly into the intranet. This app allows:

- **Holiday and absence tracking** integration — see who's on holiday to dynamically utilize hardware and workstations
- Facilities teams to **track desk allocations** and office capacity
- **Remote machine communication** for multi-location companies — report issues and coordinate hardware across sites
- Automatic syncing with **SharePoint lists** for centralized data storage

This is just one example of how **Microsoft 365 Power Apps** can be woven into the intranet experience, turning SharePoint from a static information hub into an **interactive digital workplace**. It is fully integrated with the existing M365 ecosystem and works as one connected ecosystem.

## Impact 3 years on 

Based on 70 people architectural practice, since launch, **The Hub** has become the backbone of the company’s digital workplace, with measurable engagement and adoption:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|---------|
| Homepage views | 55,000+ |
| Most visited page | BIM Primer (2,500 visits) |
| News posts published | 150+ |
| Sub-pages and resources | 50+ |
| Consultancy costs | **£0** (fully in-house) |
| Additional software costs | **£0** (covered by M365 licence) |

---

## Outcome

The Hub transformed SharePoint from a simple file store into a **powerful, tailored intranet** that supports day-to-day operations, onboarding, QA processes, and communication.  

It demonstrates how **organisations of any size can leverage Microsoft 365** to build high-impact internal systems — cost-effectively and sustainably.

> *Everything we need is now in one place. Whether it's finding a template, checking project standards, or seeing who's in the office — it's all on The Hub.*  
> **— Practice staff member**

---

## Summary

This case study highlights the potential of **SharePoint as a foundation for digital transformation** within design and engineering practices.  
With thoughtful planning and user-centred design, Microsoft 365 can power a connected, informed, and collaborative **modern workplace** — without the need for complex or costly software.
