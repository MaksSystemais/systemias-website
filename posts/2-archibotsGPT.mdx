# ChatGPT AI assistants

Archibots is a growing set of GPT-based AI assistant chatbots developed using only publicly available documentation. There are many caveats â€” and these are not tools for blind use. But they offer a glimpse into how AI might begin to support architectural and construction professionals in day-to-day tasks.

# Why Are We Doing This?

We're not claiming these bots are perfect. But the only way to understand the real-world benefits and drawbacks of AI in our industry is by actually testing it in live scenarios.

The same questions keep coming up:

- Can AI really help in architectural practice?
- How can the AEC industry responsibly integrate AI into daily workflows?

Truth is, many are hesitant. People don't trust others to use AI responsibly. Those in charge of QA slam the brakes because they don't have time to properly evaluate the tools. Insurers and lawyers often don't understand â€” or don't care. And public conversation is dominated by image-generating AI, which distracts from practical use cases.

But in practice? We're finding value.

# Real-World Examples

### Planning Appeal â€“ "Unwinnable" Case
In a tough planning case, the AI chatbot suggested three arguments. Two were unusable â€” but one opened a compelling line of reasoning. The architect dug deeper, verified the claim, and built a strong appeal based on the AI's suggestion.  
**Outcome:** The AI proved valuable in a challenging scenario.

### DfE School Design Dispute
A colleague was navigating a 300-page school design specification. We created an assistant to speed things up. It helps architects and designers quickly search and move through long documents, while clearly showing where each answer comes fromâ€”making it easy to review and validate. The result? Faster resolution of design queries and great feedback from users.

# What's Next?

We're exploring:

- AI workplace assistants for architectural teams
- Multiple topic-specific GPT bots
- Bid preparation assistants trained on company-specific historical data
- And a few other things we can't talk about yet ðŸ˜‰

# In conclusion
AI is powerful when used responsibly. It's not about replacing professionals â€” it's about augmenting our work. We're just getting started.
