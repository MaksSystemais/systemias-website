## The Problem
Managing timesheets manually can be chaotic — especially when every staff member works different hours, follows unique overtime rules, and is on varied pay schedules. Our client’s original process involved:
*   ➡️ Staff filling Excel sheets
*   ➡️ Exporting PDFs and emailing to managers
*   ➡️ Managers approving and forwarding to accounts
*   ➡️ Accountants aggregating hours by project
*   ➡️ Directors calculating wages per person

### 5 people involved just to process one timesheet.
