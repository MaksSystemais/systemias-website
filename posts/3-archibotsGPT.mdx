# ChatGPT AI assistants

Growing set of GPT-based AI assistant chatbots developed using only publicly available documentation. Whilst these tool should not be used blindly (as any other AI tool for that matter), the chatbots offer a glimpse into how AI might begin to support architectural and construction professionals in day-to-day tasks.

- You will need a GPT account (a free one works fine). 
- We cannot access your chat history.
- These GPTs use knowledge base documents and generally do not rely on online resources.
- You can ask about the knowledge base, and if your question is not relevant, you will can get incorrect output.
- We are all still learning how to use AI, so please provide feedback via letstalk@systemais.co.uk.
- You can upload drawings or even paste screen grabs and ask for suggestions or analysis.

# Real-world examples

## Planning appeal â€“ "Unwinnable" case 

In a tough planning case, where the application for new structures in green belt has been refused and the architect was going for revised application resubmission, new arguments were required to present a stronger case. Since the refusal, the NPPF has been updated, so the architect employed AI to assist with preparing the new application and improving the argument by comparing the withdrawn and new NPPF policies. 

The planning AI chatbot suggested three arguments. Whilst two were already previously used and rejects, the third one opened a compelling line of reasoning. The architect dug deeper, verified the claim, and built a stronger case based on the AI's suggestion. 

The AI proved to be valuable in this challenging scenario.

## DfE School design compliance

An architect has been challenged by the project stakeholder on the proposed corridor widths for the new school. The proposed width was non-compliant with DfE spec, which made architect question their design and the change in corridor width would have affected large portion of the design.

However, when architect outlined explained the situation to the [AI chatbot](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67975c59bd00819182c5c605bb39febf-school-design-specification-dfe-uk), it found out that the project manager was referencing withdrawn guidance, and the proposed corridor width was in fact correct. The Chatbot provided all the references to where the outdated corridor widths were listed and where the new guidance is. This made is simple for the architect to explain their case without the scrolling hundreds of pages of documentation to justify their design decisions. 

The result? Faster resolution of design queries (and potential future claims) and great feedback from users.
