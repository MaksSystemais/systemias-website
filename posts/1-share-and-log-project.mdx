# The Hidden Cost of Manual Drawing Issue Registers

In the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, there's a silent productivity killer: the manual drawing issue register. This seemingly simple document, often maintained in Excel, is a critical quality assurance requirement that tracks the distribution of project documentation. However, our research reveals that a mid-size architectural firm with 70 employees can lose up to £20,000 annually in billable hours spent maintaining these registers.

# The Problem - More Than Just Paperwork

- **Time-Consuming Process** - Architects and engineers can spend hours retrospectively manually logging document distributions
- **Inconsistent Updates** - Registers are often updated irregularly due to the manual nature of the process
- **Hidden Costs** 
  - Lost billable hours
  - Inefficient resource allocation
  - Increased risk of documentation logging errors
- **Quality Assurance Gaps** - When documentation is needed for compliance or dispute resolution, incomplete registers can lead to serious issues

# Why Existing Solutions Fall Short?
The market offers several document management systems, but they often:
❌ Require complex implementation and training
- ❌ Come with prohibitively high costs
- ❌ Fail to specifically address the drawing issue register problem
- ❌ Require significant manual input despite their digital nature
- ❌ Endless discovery calls and quotation reviews

# The Systemais Solution - Automation-First Approach

Share&Log was born from a simple observation - if we can automate the metadata extraction from drawings, we can eliminate the manual work of maintaining issue registers.

### Focus on Automation
Unlike other solutions that simply digitise the manual process, Share&Log:
- The platform automatically extracts metadata from drawings
- Generates issue registers without user input
- Maintains accurate records without additional effort
- Provides instant access to historical data
- No complex setup required
- Minimal or no training needed
- We aim to support businesses at time of soaring software costs with free affordable pricing structure
