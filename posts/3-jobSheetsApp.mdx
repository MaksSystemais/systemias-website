# Case Study: Job Sheets App for Machinery Engineers

We developed a tailored digital application specifically for machinery engineers to record, track, and manage their jobs – without the clutter and cost of oversized software.

# The Problem
Most existing job management tools are either too generic or overly complex and expensive. For engineers who just need something simple but effective, there wasn't a right-fit option.

---

# The Solution
We created a bespoke, cost-effective Power Apps solution, designed around the real workflows of freelance engineers. The system includes:
* Job tracking and status updates
* Machinery records and maintenance logs
* Client and site address databases
* Auto-generated job sheets (Repair, Service, LOLER Inspection) with image upload and email dispatch

All data is stored securely in SharePoint and works as one connected ecosystem.

---

# Key Benefits
* No more paperwork
* Increased efficiency and consistency
* Full audit trail of completed work
* Client machinery list tracking
* Professional, branded reports automatically generated and emailed to customers

# Client Collaboration
The client's team was highly dedicated and engaged, working closely with our developers to shape the app around real-life use cases and needs.

# Services Provided
* Company SharePoint setup (domain + pro email)
* Licence guidance and setup
* SharePoint intranet homepage
