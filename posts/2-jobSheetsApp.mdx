# The problem

The machinery maintenance is a job that is required to be undertaken in various site and weather conditions, yet it has to  be accurately recorded and passed on to the client for their records.

The machinery maintenance company found that existing job management tools were either too generic or overly complex and expensive for their requirements. 

As silly as it may sound, one of the issues was that apps available on market are too fiddly and a field engineer, who needs to enter data live (rain or shine, clean or oily hands..), requires something that is simple, effective and user-friendly. 

We could not find the app on the market that would right-fit option.

# The solution
We developed a tailored yet cost-effective Power Apps solution for field machinery engineers to record, track, and manage their jobs. It is designed in close collaboration with field engineers to address their workflows.
