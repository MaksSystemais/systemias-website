# The problem

Time tracking remains a challenge for many businesses. Whether you're managing field workers, office staff, or hybrid teams, capturing accurate time data for projects, clients, and tasks can be time-consuming and error-prone.

Many organisations struggle with:
* Paper-based timesheets that are difficult to track and consolidate
* Complex time tracking software with steep learning curves
* Expensive subscription-based solutions that exceed budget constraints
* Generic tools that don't fit specific business workflows
* Delayed timesheet submissions affecting payroll and project costing

---

# The solution

We've developed a comprehensive Weekly Timesheets Power App that integrates seamlessly with your Microsoft 365 environment. This downloadable solution provides a user-friendly interface for employees to log their time weekly, with all data securely stored in SharePoint.

The app features:
* Simple weekly timesheet entry interface
* Project and task categorisation
* Client tracking
* Overtime and absence recording
* Manager approval workflows
* Automated calculations and summaries
* Mobile-friendly design for on-the-go entry
