Whether you are a sole practitioner or running a small architectural practice, keeping clear records of what was issued, when, and to whom remains a fundamental professional obligation. The importance of maintaining proper documentation does not diminish with practice size - in fact, smaller practices and individual architects often face greater scrutiny during audits or investigations, making robust record-keeping even more critical. A systematic approach to tracking drawing issues, revisions, and project correspondence helps protect both you and your clients while ensuring professional standards are consistently met.

# Keeping accurate drawing issue records is a professional obligation â€“ ARB

The Architects Registration Board (ARB) Code of Conduct requires architects to maintain appropriate records that demonstrate professional decision-making, safeguard client information, and meet legal and regulatory duties. This includes tracking what information was issued, when, and to whom. In the event of a dispute, audit, or complaint, drawing issue registers often form critical evidence. Consistent record-keeping is a key part of acting with integrity and accountability and it helps protect both clients and architects.

### ðŸ“˜ ARB Code of Conduct Requirements

**Standard 4 â€“ Competent management of your business**
"4.1 You are expected to have effective systems in place to ensure that your practice is run professionally and that projects are regularly monitored and reviewed."

**Standard 6 â€“ Working conscientiously and with due regard to relevant technical and professional standards**
"You should carry out your professional work with skill and careâ€¦ keep your client informed of the progress of workâ€¦ and of any issue which may significantly affect its quality or cost." Maintaining accurate records underpins these duties. Architects Registration Board

**Standard 11 â€“ Co-operation with regulatory requirements and investigations**
"You are expected to co operate fully and promptly with ARBâ€¦ if it asks you to provide information which it needs to carry out its statutory dutiesâ€¦" Complete, accessible recordsâ€”from drawing registers to metadataâ€”are essential here. Architects Registration Board

# RIBA guidelines

The RIBA Code of Professional Conduct (2005) highlights the importance of accurate documentation as part of competent practice. Members are expected to record terms of appointment, monitor project decisions, and keep clients informed - obligations that directly rely on having structured records in place. Drawing issue registers, revision logs, and correspondence records form the foundation for transparency, client trust, and professional accountability.

### ðŸ“˜ Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Code of Professional Conduct (2005)

**Principle 2 â€“ Competence**
"Members are expected to apply high standards of skill, knowledge and care in all their work."

**Section 2.3**
"Members should ensure that their terms of appointment, the scope of their work and the essential project requirements are clear and recorded in writingâ€¦ Members should maintain appropriate records throughout their engagement."

**Section 2.4**
"Members should keep their clients informed of the progress of a project and of the key decisions made on the client's behalf."

# The Building Safety Act places clear responsibilities on designers

The Act introduces clear duties for designers, including sole practitioners, particularly when acting as dutyholders (e.g. Principal Designer). Dutyholders must ensure that accurate, up-to-date digital records are created, maintained, and made available throughout a building's lifecycle.

### ðŸ“˜ Building Safety Act 2022 â€“ Key Duties

**Schedule 1, Paragraph 1D â€“ Keeping and giving information**
"Building regulations mayâ€¦ make provision about obtaining, keeping and giving information and documentsâ€¦ including requirements as regards keeping information or documents up to date."

# Conclusion

Whether required by professional codes or legislation, keeping clear, consistent records is not optionalâ€”it is a core part of architectural responsibility. From the ARB's Code of Conduct and RIBA's professional standards to the Building Safety Act's dutyholder requirements, the message is clear: reliable documentation protects clients, safeguards practices, and upholds public trust. For sole practitioners and small firms, meeting these obligations need not be burdensomeâ€”but it must be taken seriously. Putting simple, structured systems in place for recording drawing issues and revisions is a practical step towards better compliance, accountability, and peace of mind.
